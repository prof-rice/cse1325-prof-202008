QUESTION 1: Which values of width, height, and icount did you select for your machine to generate a Mandelbrot image with 1 thread with around a 30 second runtime: 


QUESTION 2: Provide the output of ``time ./mandelbrot width height icount nthreads`` for runs with 1 through 16 threads below. You can run all of these with a single bash command if you like, e.g., (using your values in place of 2000 2000 500) ``for i in {1..16} ; do time ./mandelbrot 2000 2000 500 $i ; done``

Example Timing:

  width: 2000  height: 2000  icount: 500  threads: 1
  wrote: image.ppm

real	0m28.751s
user	0m28.715s
sys	0m0.020s


YOUR Timing:




QUESTION 3: Does adding more threads continue to speed up the program? Do more threads ever slow down the program slightly?  Why or why not?




QUESTION 4: Does adding more threads increase the "system load", or is it constant regardless of the number of threads?  Why?
